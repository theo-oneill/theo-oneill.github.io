## The Local Bubble

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-align="left"><h4><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240304961O/abstract">The Local Bubble is a Local Chimney: A New Model from 3D Dust Mapping</a></h4><p>Leveraging a high-resolution 3D dust map of the solar neighborhood from Edenhofer et al. (2023), we derive a new 3D model for the dust-traced surface of the Local Bubble, the supernova-driven cavity surrounding the Sun.</p></blockquote>

Although theory suggests that superbubble expansion is influenced by interstellar magnetic fields, direct observational data on 3D superbubble magnetic field geometry is limited.</p></blockquote>

## Molecular Clouds in Low-Metallicity Environments 

<blockquote class="embedly-card" data-card-align="left"><h4><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022ApJ...938...82O/abstract">Sequential Star Formation in the Young SMC Region NGC 602: Insights from ALMA</a></h4><p>NGC 602 is a young, low-metallicity star cluster in the "Wing" of the Small Magellanic Cloud. We reveal the recent evolutionary past of the cluster through analysis of high-resolution (~0.4 pc) Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of molecular gas in the associated H II region N90.</p></blockquote>

Cloud structure and stability are frequently assessed using metrics including the virial parameter and Larson scaling relationships between cloud radius, velocity dispersion, and surface density.</p></blockquote>

## Characterizing the Galactic Core Mass Function

Massive Protoclusters</a></h4><p>The stellar initial mass function (IMF) is fundamental for many areas of astrophysics, but its origin remains poorly understood. It may be inherited from the core mass function (CMF) or arise as a result of more chaotic, competitive accretion.</p></blockquote>

The interpretation of high-redshift SN Ia is dependent on accurate characterization of nearby, low-redshift targets. To help build up samples of nearby SN Ia, the Thacher Observatory has begun a photometric follow-up program in 4 photometric bands.</p></blockquote>
