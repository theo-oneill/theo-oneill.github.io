## Mapping the Local Bubble's Magnetic Field in 3D
<sup> <i>Advisor:  Dr. Alyssa Goodman <br> Harvard-Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory REU Program </i> </sup> 

We've created a map of magnetic fields over the surface of the Local Bubble (a large cavity in the nearby interstellar medium), which is the first  to fully map 3D magnetic fields over an observed superbubble.  More soon!

Cloud structure and stability are frequently assessed using metrics including the virial parameter and Larson scaling relationships between cloud radius, velocity dispersion, and surface density.</p></blockquote>
