I'm a research assistant at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.  My work focuses on star formation, the interstellar medium, and applications of statistics to astronomy.  

I received a B.S. in Astronomy-Physics & Statistics from the University of Virginia in December 2022.  I will start as a PhD student in Astronomy at Harvard in Fall 2023.
