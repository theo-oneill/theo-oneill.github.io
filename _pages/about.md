I'm a research assistant at the Center for Astrophysics I Harvard & Smithsonian.  My work focuses on star formation, the interstellar medium, and applications of statistics to astronomy.  

I received my B.S. in Astronomy-Physics & Statistics from the University of Virginia in December 2022.  To learn more about the Local Bubble's 3D Magnetic Field, please visit [http://tinyurl.com/local-bubble-b](http://tinyurl.com/local-bubble-b).
