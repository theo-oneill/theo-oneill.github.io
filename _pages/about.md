I'm a post-baccalaureate research assistant at the Center for Astrophysics \I Harvard & Smithsonian.  My research focuses on star formation, the interstellar medium, and applications of statistics to astronomy.  

I received my B.S. in Astronomy-Physics & Statistics from the University of Virginia in December 2022.  I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, and in my free time can usually be found hiking, backpacking, and climbing.
