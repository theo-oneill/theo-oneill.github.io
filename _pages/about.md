I'm a fourth year undergraduate at the University of Virginia.  My research focuses on star formation, the interstellar medium, and applications of statistics to astronomy.  

I will receive my B.S. in Astronomy-Physics & Statistics in December 2022.  I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area, and in my free time can usually be found hiking, backpacking, and climbing.
