I'm a PhD student in Astronomy at Harvard University.  My work focuses on star formation, the interstellar medium, and applications of statistics to astronomy.  

I received a B.S. in Astronomy-Physics & Statistics from the University of Virginia.  I am originally from the San Francisco Bay Area, and in my free time enjoy hiking and climbing.
